Blazor Boilerplate / Starter Template with MatBlazor and IdentityServer

## Goal
To create a boilerplate code base using Blazor / MatBlazor that includes most of the basic functionality of a starter kit (AspnetBoilerplate) that is lean yet powerful for anyone to build off. Hopefully we can get some contributors to review and refine the code. 

### Live demo
